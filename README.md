# Polygon NFT Lab

Experimental NFT deployment and smart contract testing on the Polygon network.

## Overview

This repository documents hands-on experiments with NFT deployment,
smart contract interaction, and marketplace listing strategies on Polygon.

The goal is to understand real-world Web3 mechanics beyond theory —
including gas behavior, listing structures, and token economics.

## Objectives

- Deploy ERC-721 / ERC-1155 contracts
- Test NFT minting workflows
- Analyze OpenSea listing behavior
- Record pricing strategy experiments
- Explore long-term Web3 application models

## Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Polygon Network
- OpenSea
- MetaMask
- Hardhat (planned)

## Current Status

Initial NFT deployment completed.
Listing strategy testing in progress.

## Research Notes

Future updates will include:

- Gas fee comparison
- Marketplace visibility analysis
- Pricing model adjustments
- Transaction flow documentation

## Vision

This lab serves as a foundation for exploring how blockchain systems
can be applied to transparency, ownership models, and decentralized value exchange.
